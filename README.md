## pg-admin

A web interface to view and modify your postgres dababases based on koa and vue.

### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# Run frontend serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Run backend api server
node index.js
```

### Todo

1. should also store db uri in localStorage (should store multiple ones)
2. add the webpack-dev-middleware and webpack-hot-middleware so that no need to run two server for this simple project
3. make the connect page as modal
4. it seems that there is no need to use vue-router
